// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements

// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

//Solution
// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design

// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysisOfRequirements =
  "Engineering teams work with stakeholders such as customers, end-users, and the business to better understand exit criteria and define success of the project.";
const design =
  "Software architecture and design is established before any real coding occurs. Software engineers work with UI/UX designers to visualize the front-end of the software. Software architects work on designing the back-end systems.";
const implementation =
  "Work begins on the application. Engineering teams divide and conquer using scrum methodology that focuses on incremental development through the use of sprints";
const testingAndIntegration =
  "Quality assurance is performed on the application to ensure reliability. Common methods can include regression testing, units tests, and automated testing";
const maintain =
  "After software has been pushed to production, engineering teams continue to maintain it by creating a backlog of work. The backlog consists of bugs and enhancements to the existing application. New code is pushed to production on a regular basis";
